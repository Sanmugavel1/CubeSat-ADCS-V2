## 📌 Project Overview

This project represents Version 2 of our CubeSat ADCS prototype.  
Unlike Version 1, which used a servo-based actuation system and basic communication setup, Version 2 focuses on:

- Realistic reaction wheel implementation  
- SDR-based communication architecture  
- Signal decoding using GNU Radio  
- Improved mechanical design with weight optimization  
- Cost-efficient engineering  

All relevant source code, design files, screenshots, and supporting documents are available inside this repository.

This version was not just an upgrade — it was a complete redesign from communication to control and mechanical structure.

## 📡 SDR-Based Communication System

### Hardware Used

- LoRa SX1278 (Transmitter)  
- RTL-SDR Module (Receiver)  

### Software Tools

- SDR++ (Spectrum Analysis)  
- GNU Radio (Signal Decoding)  

### Why SDR?

Initially, we were only visualizing the spectrum of the received signal.  
However, spectrum observation alone does not complete a communication system.

As communication engineers, we realized:

> **True communication requires decoding, not just visualization.**

Therefore, we implemented GNU Radio-based decoding to interpret the transmitted data properly.

### Major Challenge

The decoding stage took nearly 2–3 days of debugging.  
We faced:

- Incorrect block configurations  
- Sample rate mismatches  
- Flowgraph debugging issues  

Successfully decoding the signal provided immense practical learning in SDR systems.

GNU Radio flowgraphs, SDR spectrum screenshots, and configuration files are included within this repository.

## ⚙️ ADCS – Reaction Wheel Mechanism

### Why Reaction Wheel?

In Version 1, a servo actuator was used.  
In Version 2, we upgraded to a real reaction wheel mechanism for 1-axis roll control.

Reaction wheels are widely used in real satellites for attitude control, making this implementation closer to practical aerospace systems.

### Working Principle

- When the reaction wheel accelerates in one direction,  
- The Cube rotates in the opposite direction (Newton’s Third Law).  

This enables roll control without external torque.

Firmware source code and control implementation details are available in the repository.

## 🔌 ESC Challenge

A major hardware limitation emerged:

We only had a unidirectional ESC.

For proper 1-axis ADCS:
- The motor must rotate in + roll and – roll directions.

However:
- Our ESC required manual polarity reversal.

We searched for a bidirectional ESC:
- Ritchie Street  
- Online platforms  
- College departments  

It was unavailable everywhere.

Finally, we completed the system using available components.

This taught us an important engineering lesson:

> **Real projects are completed not with perfect resources, but with problem-solving mindset.**

## 🧱 Mechanical Design

### Design Goals

- Minimum cost  
- Maximum functionality  
- Compact structure  

### Specifications

- Cube Dimension: 15 × 15 cm  
- Load: ~600–700 grams  

### Materials Used

- Sunboards (Structure)  
- Acrylic Sheets (Base)  
- DIY Plastic Shaft Material  
- 3D Printed Bearing Holder (Only essential component printed)  

### Major Mechanical Challenge

Weight balancing.

With 600–700g inside a compact cube:
- Improper distribution affected stability  
- Reaction wheel performance was impacted  

After multiple iterations and redistribution techniques, stable balance was achieved.

Mechanical design notes, structural images, and documentation are included in this repository.
